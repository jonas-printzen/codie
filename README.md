# Codie - C++ library

This is a manifestation of my preferred style of C++20 programming. Decided to put
it on github for my own convenience. It is designed in conjunction with some of my 
own tools and snippets, so I can quickly try out design ideas, as well as writing
some useful tools. At the start of this project (Summer 2022) the code was spread 
across several private code-bases and repositories. I intend to pick the parts I 
use the most and simply use it when I get an idea or challange.

For my own use! No batteries included!
