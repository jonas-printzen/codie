/** @defgroup COMMON Common types
 *
 * @brief DRY starts with commonalities
 *
 * The common types are used throughout the code to provide
 * abstraction-friendly base complementing standard libraries.
 * By explicitly setting some types that are common I find it 
 * easier to prototype API's that are concise and useful.
 *
 * This is still just an embryo, I intend to move constructs
 * that I find particularly usefull as I go along.
 *
 * When prototyping and testing out stuff, I do it my way!
